# Scala

* It’s a high-level language
* It’s statically typed
* Its syntax is concise but still readable — we call it *expressive*
* It supports the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm
* It supports the functional programming (FP) paradigm
* It has a sophisticated type inference system
* Scala code results in *.class* files that run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
* It’s easy to use Java libraries in Scala
* Pure object-oriented language
  * Every value is an object
* Functional language
  * Every function is a value
* Pure Expression Oriented Language
  * everything is an expression
  * every expression computes to a value ( most of the times )
  * every value has a type
  * every value is an object even functions
  * no goto, no break, no continue, inferred return , inferred semicolon
  * less unnecessary curly braces , less parenthesis 
  *  
* Scalable Language
  * regular
  * concise
  * powerful

Float		32 bit IEEE 754 single-precision float

Double		64 bit IEEE 754 double-precision float

Char		16 bit unsigned Unicode character

String		sequence of characters

Boolean		true or false

Unit		Void

Null

## Variables in Scala

A variable is mutable , typed storage unit.

An assigned variable can be reassigned



##  Literals

A literal or literal data is data that appears directly in source code.

ex . : number 5, character A, text "Hello World"

These are immutable in nature by default.

- INTEGER
- FLOATING POINT
- BOOLEAN
- CHARACTER
- STRING
- MULTILINE STRING



- The return type of function is determined by the type of last expression present in the function.
- In Scala, there are no static variables or methods. Scala uses singleton object, which is essentially class with only one object in the source file. Singleton object is declared by using object instead of class keyword.
- In Scala, computation is lazy by default. Scala evaluates expressions only when they are required. You can declare a lazy variable by using lazy keyword. It is used to increase performance.

## Traits

Interfaces

Java - No multiple Inheritance

traits = abstract and non-abstract methods
